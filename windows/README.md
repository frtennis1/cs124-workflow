Windows
=======

Windows is really weird, and most of our staff doesn't use it. Here are some
things to start Googling:
* For Java, download Eclipse or IntelliJ.
* For Python, use PyCharm or write in Sublime Text and run in the terminal.
* For C/C++, use Atom or Visual Studio Code.
* For large test cases, use IO redirection - see the [Linux guidelines](../linux).

If you're using Python, once you get a Python installation and a terminal
emulator you should be able to follow the basic ideas of the Linux guidelines.
