Python
======

This repo includes a script with some examples of generating random test data.
Remember you can run your code easily with `python submission.py`.

With Python, also remember that while there are lots of convenient list
operations, they can be unintentionally costly. List concatenation takes
linear time, and list slicing creates new lists which also takes linear time.
Checking list membership is linear time, while checking set membership is
average case constant time.
